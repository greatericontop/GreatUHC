## Game Overview

When the game is started, everyone is teleported to a bedrock platform. You'll get some time to choose a kit.

Then, you'll be teleported randomly in the map. This is the grace period, and you have 15 minutes to peacefully gather materials.

After the grace period, everyone is allowed to fight.

Later after that, Deathmatch will begin. Everyone will be teleported to a randomly generated arena and forced to fight there until the end of the game.
